<h1 class="heading">Build Real-world Applications</h1>

<p class="text-content text-content-subpage">Coding on an already existing, on-going  site is much different than creating a small app from scratch—and, it’s how web development works outside of the classroom. So, unlike most bootcamps, we’ve setup partnerships with open-source, non-profit organizations who already have a presence on the web. Once you’ve proven yourself with smaller projects, you’ll learn how coding works in the real world. And, no, we aren’t making any money off of these jobs—so we pick only the ones that will be of most benefit to you and your learning.</p>

<p class="text-content text-content-subpage">Our unique async learning model means you’ll start out on these projects as a junior developer and will work with a small team and a product manager. As you gain experience, you’ll move into more lead roles on your team. And, along the way, we’ll show you tools like <a data-ng-href="https://github.com/isomeredu">GitHub</a>, <a data-ng-href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>, and the <a data-ng-href="http://agilemethodology.org/">Scrum Agile</a> process that professional web devs use, so when you get your first job you'll already know all of the tricks.</p>

        <p class="text-content">Were you always the fastest kid in your kindergarten class—the first to spell ‘Dog’ or count
            to 10? Or, maybe you’re more of a wandering soul? Our Mastery Learning Model is designed specifically to
            ensure everyone learns at their own pace and are not held back or rushed by the pace of a one-size-fits-all
            classroom. When you’re ready, you’ll advance to more sophisticated and challenging positions on your team and to
            new teams with new projects.

        <h4 class="sub-heading head-room">Blended Classroom</h4>

        <p class="text-content">We’re not your parents, so you won’t be getting lectures from us. We don’t have preplanned
            topics that we’ll shove down your throat. Instead, all instruction is based on what we see actually happening
            with either with the class, a team, or an individual. Occasionally, instructors will help facilitate group
            discussions and provide quick overviews of concepts that apply to a specific problem or context. And, then we
            have you immediately apply these discussion and contexts in exercises or with your team’s current project.</p>

        <h4 class="sub-heading head-room">Quick-start Code Module </h4>

        <p class="text-content">Our quick-start coding module ensures students enter the classroom with the programming
            background they’ll need to succeed. Intended primarily for students with little to no programming experience in
            JavaScript (but open to anyone!), you’ll work alongside other quick-start students through pre-course material
            designed specifically to teach the fundamentals of JavaScript, and the libraries will be using in the classroom.
            You’ll have the same access to instructors and to open office hours as everyone else, and the module is provided
            at no extra cost.</p>

        <p class="text-content">Practice what you preach. We’ve created an online dashboard application so you can track
            your progress through the course to see your strengths and weaknesses, currently and over time. Instructors will
            also use the dashboard when providing feedback on your progress. </p>
